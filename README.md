# Quasar Labs

 **Where dApps get tested  **

Quasar Labs is a mobile-built dApp testing platform for NEAR Protocol, powered by Lava Network’s RPC endpoints. It scans NEAR testnet contracts to verify deployment, test function calls, and detect issues, displaying results with:
- ✅ Working functions and deployment.
- ❌‼️⚠️ Bugs or malfunctions with specific errors.
- 👀 Potential security concerns (e.g., unexpected behavior). "road map"

## Features
- Input any NEAR testnet contract address (e.g., `guest-book.testnet`).
- Checks contract deployment and basic function calls.
- Reports working components, broken functions, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Quasarrowa/Quasarlabs`.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or visit `https://quasarrowa.github.io/Quasarlabs/`.
3. Enter a NEAR testnet contract address and click "Run Test".

## Future Vision
- Advanced security scanning for unauthorized access (“spies”).
- Detailed function-by-function analysis of dApps.
- Support for mainnet and cross-chain testing.

Built on a mobile phone using Textastic, leveraging NEAR’s subsidized Lava Starter RPC Plan.
