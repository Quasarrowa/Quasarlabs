# Quasar Labs

 "Where dApps get tested"

Quasar Labs is a mobile built dApp testing platform for NEAR Protocol, powered by Lava Network’s RPC endpoints. It scans NEAR testnet contracts to verify deployment, test function calls, and detect issues displaying results with:
 Working functions and deployment.
-Bugs or malfunctions with specific errors.
-Potential security concerns (e.g unexpected behavior). "road map"

## Features
- Input any NEAR testnet contract address (e.g., `guest-book.testnet`).
- Checks contract deployment and basic function calls.
- Reports working components, broken functions, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Quasarrowa/Quasarlabs`.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or visit `https://quasarrowa.github.io/Quasarlabs/`.
3. Enter a NEAR testnet contract address and click "Run Test".

## Future Vision
- Advanced security scanning for unauthorized access (“spies”).
- Detailed function-by-function analysis of dApps.
- Support for mainnet and cross-chain testing.

Built on a mobile phone using Textastic, leveraging NEAR’s subsidized Lava Starter RPC Plan.
